### Simulation Models

With the simulation models, you can have a simulation model which is a 4ohm resistor for example\. But there is no information coming from an external file and thus no external file is needed for this resistor as the resistor model is built from Spice modeling language in Altium Designer\. This is the case where you have a model with no data file entity\.

Thus the parameters are used for these types of simulation models that don’t have data file links \(external files\)\. Simulation Models can have up to 3 different model data files – Model File\(\*\.MDL\), Subcircuit file \(\*\.CKT\) and SIMetrix Model Library file \(\*\.LB\)\.
