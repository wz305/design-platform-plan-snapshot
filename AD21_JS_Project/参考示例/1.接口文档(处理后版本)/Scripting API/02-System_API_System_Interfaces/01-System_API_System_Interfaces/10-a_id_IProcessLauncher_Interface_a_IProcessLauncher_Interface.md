__Overview__  
This IProcessLauncher interface is a mechanism that launches a server process in Altium Designer\. See ICommandLauncher and IServerProcess interfaces as well\.

Since a server has a set of processes and these process identifiers are stored in an installation file \(which ends with an INS extension\) and the process launchers that link to specific user interface elements \(also called resources\) and the layout of user interface elements are defined in the resources file \(which ends with a RCS extension\)\.
