### <a id="IComponentClass_interface"></a>IComponentClass interface

__Overview__  
The IComponentClass interface is a PCB Component class object interface for an existing Component Class on a PCB document\. An existing Component class contains members of specific Components\. Each Component within a ComponentClass object can either be a member or not\. The ‘All Components’ Component Class exists in every PCB document by default, it includes all Components in the document\. It is not possible to change which components are members of that Component class, but the user has full control over which components are members of any other Component classes \(which are created and named by the User\)\.  
__Notes__  
Inherited from IObjectClass interface\.
