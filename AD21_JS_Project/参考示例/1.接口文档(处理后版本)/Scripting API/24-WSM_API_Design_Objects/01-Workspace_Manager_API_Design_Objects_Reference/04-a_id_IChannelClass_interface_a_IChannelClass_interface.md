__Overview__  
The IChannelClass interface is a PCB Channel class object interface for an existing Channel Class on a PCB document\. An existing Channel \(room\) class contains members of specific components\. Each component within a Channel Class object can either be a member or not\.

The ‘All Components’ Channel Class exists in every PCB document by default, it includes all Components in the document\. It is not possible to change which components are members of that Channel class, but the user has full control over which components are members of any other Channel classes \(which are created and named by the User\)\.  
__Notes__  
Inherited from IObjectClass interface\.
